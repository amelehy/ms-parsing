        "description": "Arctic Information Technology (Arctic IT) is a 100% Native-Owned Enterprise that provides business applications and network management for three distinct verticals:  Tribal Government and Enterprise, Federal and the Alaska SMB market.  For over 16 years, our team has been recognized as a uniquely talented team by Microsoft as an industry leader and we’ve been repeatedly recognized as the top managed services provider in Alaska. \n\nTribal. Arctic IT developed a proprietary business application, Tribal Platforms™ Tribal Enrollment. It is designed to enhance every facet of member management. Built on the Microsoft Dynamics platform, this application allows each tribal department access to information from one source.  The member’s PHI stays compliant because each department has access to only the information they need.  Most importantly, the member doesn’t have to fill out additional forms each time they are served by a department. \n\nFederal. Arctic IT’s experienced team has the background to help manage finances, human resources, citizen relationships, funds and grants, and service delivery—all with a low total cost of ownership. Every day, our solutions are used by government organizations to provide more effective services with greater accountability.\n\nManaged Services.  We’re proud to be working with small to medium-sized businesses in this space and have been recognized as the leading provider of managed services in Alaska for the past two years.  The value of TotalCare goes well beyond your typical IT partnership, and provides the peace-of-mind every business owner needs to have in the changing environment.",
