        "description": "Syvantis is a Microsoft ERP Gold Partner with 20 years of experience focused on providing cloud ERP and CRM solutions to businesses of all sizes. Recognized as the Microsoft Dynamics SMB ERP US Cloud Partner of the Year for FY15, Syvantis draws on its more than fifteen of years of expertise to implement, train, and support Dynamics GP and Dynamics NAV to clients from a wide range of industries. From discreet manufacturing to print and publication, consultants from Syvantis take the time to learn about their clients’ unique business needs and craft a solution to fulfill them.\n\nFrom the first call through implementation, Syvantis strives to gather a comprehensive picture of each client in order to provide detailed, upfront, and valuable pricing and product information. Instead of making clients jump through hoops and sit through multiple discovery calls to get pricing, Syvantis consultants provide estimates upfront – often after the very first time clients reach out. For those still in the early stages of their ERP search, a self-service estimation calculator is featured on the Syvantis website. Every implementation and cloud migration project is offered as a fixed-price project to ensure clients never have to worry about scope creep and is completed in as little as 4 to 6 weeks. \n\nIn today’s data-driven world, it is often imperative for businesses to integrate their vital business systems. That’s why Syvantis specializes in integrating Dynamics ERP with a host of other software. Whether clients are looking to integrate with customer relationship management tools such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM or Salesforce, to expense management software such as Concur, or to powerful data visualization tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Syvantis has the expertise in-house to do it.\n\nLong after an implementation project is complete, Syvantis continues to go above and beyond to make sure each client’s system grows and changes as they do. Free, monthly or quarterly meetings with a dedicated consultant give each client the opportunity to ask questions about their system and gain insight into new features and tools on a regular basis. When an issue arises, the Syvantis support team will be ready to triage the problem and create a case so that users can return to their duties quickly.",
