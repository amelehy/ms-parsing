        "description": "Aureon Technology is a full-service technology provider established in 1994 to provide businesses with solutions for software development and licensing, networking, IT staffing and IT management. By providing a broad range of services, we can offer a suite of solutions that is unrivaled in the region. Technologies that in the past were disparate and fragmented have become interdependent. Web sites rely on databases. Applications rely on wide area networks. And so on. Most technology firms address individual portions of the technology landscape, often creating gaps between areas that need to be tightly knit together. By offering a single-source provider, a company can reduce the complexities associated with coordinating services between multiple providers.",

Once, we were just about reactions to IT problems for our clients, showing up to fix computers when they were broken, selling some new products when the old ones just wouldn’t turn back on again. It was just the way of things.\n\nNo more, though. Seven years ago, we changed our ownership and leadership, and that meant renewing the way we work with our clients. We want to be more than just the fix-it people now – we want to be your partner. You use your information technology every day, but so many businesses just see it as a boring old tool to get the job done.\n\nWe think IT can be more than that.\n\nToday, we focus on the needs of your business before the needs of your technology. The two should go hand-in-hand. When we come to work with you, our first questions aren’t going to be about your computer systems. We want to know who you are and what you want your technology to do for you.",
