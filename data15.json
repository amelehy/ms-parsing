        "description": "A privately held company, Combined Systems Technology (CST) was founded in 1980. Combined Systems Technology CST designs and delivers Information Technology (IT) solutions which integrate architecture, engineering, hardware, software, and services that support our client’s business processes. We operate in Iowa within a broad range of markets in both the public and private sectors. CST uses a range of engineering and technology expertise to unify and simplify our clients' information technology. \n\nWe help our clients gain a competitive advantage by deploying proven technology solutions to make their businesses more resilient to market opportunities and threats. When we improve the IT infrastructure availability for our clients, they often strengthen relationships with their customers by improving productivity and reduce information technology costs. We tend not to work with contracts but usually rely on our day to day performance.\n\nCST actively supports 400 clients with day to day technology support. There are over 300 other clients that depend on CST for IT products and services. Additionally we provide specialized print systems for thousands of auto dealership customers in our dealer division. CST has been in business for over 36 years and has supported IT networks for all of those years. We have many satisfied clients that been with us 12 to 15 years having the same engineer and salesperson team assisting them.  CST employs 30 full-time staff in our Clive office and have no part time employees or contractors at this time. CST, however, has a small list of strategic partners that we leverage to provide specialized technologies services.\n\nMany of our client partners are small- to medium-size professional firms who realize the importance of technology but do not possess the resources for a dedicated IT staff. Wearing many hats is a job requirement in small business; however, devoting sufficient time to address IT incidents without ignoring the core business is next to impossible. Clients find they can rely on CST to provide them with a comprehensive solution that meets their requirements.   Put simply, we provide the IT conduit that enables our clients to grow and prosper.",
